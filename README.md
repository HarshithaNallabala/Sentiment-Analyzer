# Sentiment-Analyzer
Designed and developed a real-time Sentiment Analysis system integrated with a chatbot and a simple web interface. The system identifies whether user input expresses a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning.

->Technologies Used: Python, Flask, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, NLTK, Scikit-learn, Pandas

->Key Features:

•Clean, responsive web interface for user interaction

•Preprocessing pipeline: tokenization, stopword removal, stemming

•Trained ML model (e.g., Logistic Regression or Naive Bayes) for sentiment prediction

•Chatbot functionality: responds based on the sentiment of the message

•Realtime sentiment result displayed with visual indicators (emoji or color-coded text)

•Easy integration for feedback analysis, customer support, or review platforms

->Outcome: The project demonstrates how machine learning can enhance conversational interfaces by detecting user emotions, improving user experience and engagement.
